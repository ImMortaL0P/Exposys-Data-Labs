# Exposys-Data-Labs
This repository contains all the data files and reports that were used in making the Internship Report for 'Human Resources' in Exposys Data Labs | 12th August, 2021 to 23 Sept 2021
Exposys Data Labs Aims to Solve Real World Business Problems Like Automation, Big Data and Data Science.
Their Core Team of Experts in Various Technologies Help Businesses to Identify Issues, Opportunities and
Prototype Solutions Using Trending Technologies Like AI, ML, Deep Learning and Data Science. They Follow a
Human-Focused and Not Technology Driven Approach to Achieve Success in Their Clients Endeavors.
In the Human Resources Project, I have tried to manually collect and verify as many data as possible
In the time duration of 35 days. The data to be collected consisted of 6 Fields namely:
1. The college name
2. The state in which the college is situated
3. Principal’s Name
4. Principal’s Email
5. Training and Placement Officer Email
6. TPO Email
Most of the colleges had the following details on their website readily available and easily accessible, while many
other didn’t had the info available directly so had to contact the persons concerned through linked in and other
platforms. Since collecting all the data from colleges’ websites was a time consuming and hence I looked online for
different resources which contained the required data in condensed format and processed them in my desired
format.
The data collected is hence sorted majorly in two groups namely:
1. The manually collected and verified data
2. The mass scavenged data from different government and Institutional records
The mass scavenged data is then further divided in three sections:
1. AICTE Records
2. TEQIP Records
3. Private Institutional Records
Since Some of the colleges didn’t contain the name of their TPO, a lot of the data is having that field as empty and
due to time constraint, I was unable to collect the same manually for every single college whose data is entered in the
records.
In the end I Have tried my best to eliminate all the data redundancy, but some might have crept in the record. For
that I sincerely apologize. I have also tried my best to include all the Tier-A Engineering colleges in India, including
almost all of IIT’s and NIT’s, and most of the big names in the private Engineering college.
